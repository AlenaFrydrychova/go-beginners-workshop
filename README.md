#### Arrays
In Go, an array is a collection of elements that have the same type. This collection has a fixed size: once you declare an array, its size cannot increase or decrease.

```go
array := [5]int{5, 4, 3, 2, 1}
```
Above we have declared an array with 5 elements, in which each element is an integer.
